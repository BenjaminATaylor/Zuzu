### Pipeline plan:

## Simple version: work with a single test set and produce certain reproducibility metrics

# Input
A dataframe or matrix containing raw gene counts, from nf-core RNAseq
A sample sheet giving sample IDs and values for a single binary categorical variables
(optionally) A specification of the reference condition (important for DE analyses)

# Process

1. Check that the dataframe and matrix are valid and conform
Do the sample names in the two match?
Is there a condition, is it binary and categorical, and does it match the supplied reference level?
Are there non-numeric values within the counts matrix?

2. Clean the counts matrix. This has to be well-standardised so that we have comparable data before moving onto the next steps
Coerce all counts to integers
Cut low counts, two ways: simple per-sample cut and per-group cut (does at least one group meet minimum) (GIVE THE OPTION TO SKIP THIS)
Generate output reports: how many genes cut by each method, how many remain

3. Quality control. Generate some output plots, and perhaps a text report? Can this auto-flag outliers?
PCA/MDS with treatments labeled (can we also label sources of technical variation? Lanes?)
Cook's distances plot
pheatmap of sample distances

4. DESeq2 initial analysis
